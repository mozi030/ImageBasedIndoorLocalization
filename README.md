# ImageBasedIndoorLocalization

This is my final-year-project in Sun-yatsen university.
This project asks users to take photos in an indoor site to help them locate themselves.
The project first detects the SURF feature of the photos, and then compare them with the features in database.

Techniques used:
feature recognition, triangulation, map-constraint.
